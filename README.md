# LevelUP#4 (#5?)

It was asked to continue the develpment of a Notes App. We had to build a specifc screen (see screen shots). We had a Figma design project to follow.

Features needed:
- widget componentization
- some navigation

Features added (plus what was needed):
- mock data (at controller);

Dependencies:
- flutter_staggered_grid_view: ^0.4.0
- date_format: ^2.0.2
- focused_menu: ^1.0.5 (for context menu, unfortunatelly it is not exactly the same as figma's project)
